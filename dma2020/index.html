In his practice, Martin works with video, VR/AR and performative data collection to investigate the peripheries of the ever-changing human-machine relationship. The essence of this research focuses on understanding socio-technical and cybernetic processes in which we heavily depend on in the Age of Information and how they can be reenacted. In Martin&rsquo;s recent work, Please Listen Carefully as the Menu Options Have Changed, a toll free number is used to collect data from the caller&rsquo;s dreams. This raw data is then translated into visualizations that essentially generate summaries of the users who&rsquo;ve engaged with the work. The outcome of this piece is unknown as its, self-governing body relies on engagement and attention from the user.</span> <a href="https://mvguevara.github.io"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://mvguevara.github.io</span></a></p>

<p><strong>Christian Calinawan</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Calinawan&rsquo;s creative work involves creating 3D digital models in such a way that they appear as if they could be illustrations. When he first began working with art, he started with creating 2D illustrations but as he explored different mediums, he found himself enjoying working in and preferring 3D modeling. His pieces are illustrations created in a different way, especially as the models are textured and stylized with a cartoony, illustrative style. He makes 3D models as it is the medium he enjoys working with the most and sees great potential in the future and with improving technology, the possibilities seem endless. Through this project, Christian explores the idea of discovering oneself during this era of COVID-19 by making pieces of people exploring hobbies.</span></p>

<p><strong>Austin Glueck</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My artwork is about creating an atmosphere and sense of place. My preferred medium, or mediums, are game engines. I find interactive explorable scenes and video games to be among the best vehicles for delivering a sense of place and atmosphere. On top of this, the degree of agency they allow makes them excellent for creating artwork that engages the viewer directly with it's themes. I make it a goal to have any expository elements I'd like to include in a piece be as implicit as possible, the place should tell you its story in the way that it looks and sounds (and if possible, smells and feels).&nbsp;</span></p>
